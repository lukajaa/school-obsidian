Figure 18.13 is useful as an explanation of how exons work
Figure 18.14 shows how slective degradation works

There are RNA molecules that can block expression of mRNA by degeading them

The initation of translation can be a point where gene regulation can occur
- Lacking poly a tails at first, adenine cna be added which allows for translation

Protein post-translational processing
- Adding functional groups and transporting the proteins to different places changes their function

How long proteins last in the cell are also regulated by proteasomes which can selectively degrade things.
