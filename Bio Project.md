Figure 18.13 is useful as an explanation of how exons work
Figure 18.14 shows how slective degradation works

- What is RNA splicing?
	[[RNA]] splicing is the process of cutting out the [[Introns]] from the pre-mRNA and binding together the [[Exons]] to create a continuous code
- How does RNA splicing work?
	snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) recognize [[Nucleotides]] sequences at the ends of [[Introns]]. They combine with each other and other [[Protein]]s to create a **spliceosome** which removes and degreades the [[Introns]] and binds together the [[Exons]].
- Why do spliceosomes have [[RNA]]?
	Because they can latch onto certain parts of the pre-[[mRNA]] cuz of nucleotide binding

## Alternative RNA splicing
- What is alternative RNA splicing?
	Different segments of the pre mRNA can be treated as [[Exons]] meaning that multiple types of [[Protein]]s can be made from the same gene
- What are some effects of alternative RNA splicing?
	It can help create genetic diversity because it increases the chance of genetic mixing with more [[Nucleotides]] to change.
