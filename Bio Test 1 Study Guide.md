# Basics
- What is a enzyme?
	A enzyme is a kind of [[Protein]] that acts as a catalyst for chemical reactions.
	
- What is a eukaryote?
	A eukaryote has chromosomes in a distinct [[Nucleus]], as opposed to having them hang freely like in [[Prokaryotes]]
- What is a nucleotide?
	Nucleotides are nitrogen bases with a sugar backbone and are the monomers for both [[RNA]] and [[DNA]]
- What are the types of nucleotide found in DNA? in RNA?
	Adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. thymine is substituted for uracil in RNA.
# DNA / Packaging
- What is a chromosome?
	A chromosome is a group of [[Genes]] made up of [[DNA]], tightest form of DNA
	
 - What is DNA?
	DNA carries the genetic information of the body
- What is the monomer of DNA?
	[[Nucleotides]]
- What is the central Dogma
	The central dogma is the idea that [[DNA]] --> [[RNA]] --> [[Protein]]
- Around how long is all of the DNA in one cell?
	2 meters
- What are histones?
	Positively charged proteins that help to coil long strands of DNA
- What is the resulting DNA-protein complex called?
	Chromatin
- What is a nucleosome?
	A nucleosome is a group of eight histome proteins and around 146 DNA bases
- What are beads on a string?
	They are nucleosomes with linking DNA.
- How long is the string of nucleosomes?
	About one foot long, but still too large to fit into a nucleus
==- How does DNA coil and uncoil to be copied?==
	Histones can be modified by enzymes (acetyl, methyl, or phosphate) OR chromatin rendering complexes can remodel the DNA and expose sequences for polymerases to access. These are all reversible
- Why is DNA coiled the tightest in metaphase?
	Because it needs to be divided into its two daughter cells. Once it has been divided, it can uncoil again.
- What happens when a cell undergoes mitosis?
	The cell's chromatin packages tightly into chromosomes and then unpackages back into chromatin after it splits. 
# Proteins
- What are amino acids?
	Amino acids are the monomers of [[Protein]]s
- How many amino acids are there?
	20
# Transcription
- What is a codon?
	A codon is a group of three [[nucleotides]] that are translated into a [[protein]]
-  Why triplets of RNA bases?
    Because it was the minimum amount of letters that could have enough possible combinations.
- What is mRNA?
	mRNA is a type of [[RNA]] that acts as the messenger for the translation of [[Nucleotides]] to [[Protein]]s
- What is pre mRNA?
	Pre mRNA is a type of mRNA that only occurs in [[Eukaryotes]] and is a preprocessed version of mRNA that will eventually be let out of the [[Nucleus]] 
- What is RNA polymerase?
	RNA polymerase is the enzyme that splits DNA at the [[Promoter]] and then moves down the [[DNA]] 5' to 3' strand and finally ends at the [[Terminator]]
- How many nucleotides does RNA polymerase reveal at a time?
	10-20, around 40 nucleotides per second in [[Eukaryotes]]
- How does transcription work?
	[[DNA]] double helix is split by [[RNA Polymerase]] and corresponding nucleotides are created in a [[RNA]] strand. This is known as [[mRNA]].
- What is a primary transcript?
	A primary transcript is the initial RNA transcript from a gene including parts of RNA that will not be translated.
- What is the template strand?
	The template strand is the half of the DNA that is transcribed to RNA. The other strand is the coding strand.
- What process follows transcription in [[Eukaryotes]]?
	[[RNA Processing]]
- In which direction are [[mRNA]] strands transcribed?
	5' --> 3'
- What is one way transcription varies between pro and [[Eukaryotes]]?
	In [[Prokaryotes]] the [[RNA Polymerase]] binds directly to the DNA, while in eukaryotes enzymes called [[Transcription Factor]]s are needed for the [[RNA Polymerase]] to bind.

- What is a transcription factor?
	Transcription factors are a collection of proteins that mediate the binding of [[RNA Polymerase]] and the start of [[Transcription]]
- What is a transcription initiation complex?
	It is when all of the transcription factors have bound to the [[Promoter]] and then the [[RNA Polymerase]] can bind
- What is a transcription unit?
	A transcription unit is the section of [[DNA]] that RNA polymerase goes over to copy into a [[RNA]] strand during [[Transcription]]
## Initiation
- What is the promoter?
	The promoter is the part of the DNA before the [[Transcription Unit]] that [[RNA Polymerase]] latches onto to start [[Transcription]]
- What is the start point?
	The start point is the exact [[Nucleotides]] within the promoter where [[RNA]] synthesis actually begins
- What is a TATA box?
	It is a series of [[Nucleotides]] that contain TATA and they are a crucial promoter that brings in the [[transcription factor]]

## Termination
- What is the terminator?
	The terminator is the end of the [[Transcription Unit]] and is where the [[RNA]] transcript is released and where the [[RNA Polymerase]] detaches.
- What is the Rho factors?
	It is a part of the [[DNA]] that is transcribed to the [[RNA]]. An enzyme then binds and moves up the strand to tell the [[RNA Polymerase]] to stop
- What is Rho independent termination?
	It is where a bunch of Cs and Gs are added to the end of [[RNA]] so that it folds into itself and breaks off
## Processing
- What is an exon?
	An exon is a part of the pre [[mRNA]] that is used as code to synthesize [[Protein]]s.
- What is an intron?
	An intron is a part of the transcribed pre-[[mRNA]] that is not expressed in the creation of [[Protein]]s so it is cut out during the process of [[RNA Splicing]]
- Where does RNA Processing occur?
	RNA processing occurs in the [[Nucleus]]
- What is the polyandenylation signal?
	It is a series of AAUAAA [[Nucleotides]] that is appended to the pre mRNA after the stop [[codons]].

- What is the 5' cap?
	The 5' cap is a modified form of the guanine [[Nucleotides]] added to the 5' side of the RNA
- What is the poly-A tail?
	The poly- A tail is a long strand of 5-250 adenine [[Nucleotides]] added to the 3' side of the per mRNA after the polyandenylation signal is detected
- What do the 5' cap and poly-A tail do?
	1. They help export completed mRNA out of the [[Nucleus]]
	2. They help the mRNA from being degraded
	3. They help bind to [[Ribosome]]s append to the 5' side of the RNA

- What is RNA splicing?
	[[RNA]] splicing is the process of cutting out the [[Introns]] from the pre-mRNA and binding together the [[Exons]] to create a continuous code
- How does RNA splicing work?
	snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) recognize [[Nucleotides]] sequences at the ends of [[Introns]]. They combine with each other and other [[Protein]]s to create a **spliceosome** which removes and degreades the [[Introns]] and binds together the [[Exons]].
- Why do spliceosomes have [[RNA]]?
	Because they can latch onto certain parts of the pre-[[mRNA]] cuz of nucleotide binding
- What is alternative RNA splicing?
	Different segments of the pre mRNA can be treated as [[Exons]] meaning that multiple types of [[Protein]]s can be made from the same gene
- What are some effects of alternative RNA splicing?
	It can help create genetic diversity because it increases the chance of genetic mixing with more [[Nucleotides]] to change.
# Translation
- What is a polyribosome?
	It is where multiple ribosomes spaced apart latch onto the same [[mRNA]] strand and all make the same polypeptide [[protein]]
- What is the reading frame?
	Reading frame is how nucleotide "words" are read. You have to start in the right place and not overlap for it to work correctly.
- What happens after translation?
	The polypeptide [[protein]] gets packaged, folded, and then occasionally shipped to other parts of the cell
## tRNA
- What is Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase?
	It is an enzyme that matches the correct [[amino acid]] to a [[tRNA]] that has the proper anticodon
- How does it do its task?
	Its active sites bind for one specific [[tRNA]] and [[amino acid]]
- How many types are there?
	20, one for each [[amino acid]]
- What is tRNA?
	tRNA is a type of [[RNA]] folded in on itself with an anticodon that detects for a certain [[Codons]] to add to a polypeptide [[Protein]] chain. They each hold one [[Amino Acid]]
- What is the nucleotide make up of tRNA?
	It is made of around 80 [[nucleotides]] with pairs that can bond to each other so that it folds into itself.
- How is an anticodon coded?
	It is coded as the opposite of the [[mRNA]] codon it is matching to so that it can latch onto it in the [[ribosome]]
- How is tRNA made?
	It comes from [[DNA]] just like [[mRNA]], but it serves a different purpose
## Ribosomes
- What is a ribosome?
	It is a [[Organelle]] that translates [[mRNA]] to [[Protein]]s
- Where are the two places where ribosomes are found?
	In the [[Cytoplasm]] and embedded on other organelles like the [[Golgi Apparatus]], [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]], [[Nuclear Envelope]], [[Lysosome]]s, [[Vacuole]]s, and [[Plasma Membrane]]
- How does a ribosome know where to go?
	[[Translation]] of a polypeptide always starts in the [[Cytoplasm]], but if a signal peptide is detected by a signal-recognition particle (SRP) then the SRP brings it to where it needs to go. the signal peptide is later removed. Translation is only interuppted if it is moving the the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]
- What is the structure of a ribosome?
	It is a two unit organelle that has [[rRNA]]
- Where does the [[mRNA]] bind?
	In the smaller unit
- What is the A-site
	It is where the [[tRNA]] binds and where the the peptide carried by the tRNA first binds
- What is the P-site
	It is where the polypeptide comes out of and is where the tRNA goes
- What is the E-Site?
	It is where the [[tRNA]] exits
## Initionation:
- What is initiation?
	[[mRNA]] binds to the smaller unit of the [[ribosome]], then [[tRNA]](always the MET [[amino acid]]) binds and then the large unit  of the [[ribosome]] comes down onto it. 
- What resources does initiation require?
	[[GTP]] and initiation factors

## Elongation
- What is the cycle of translation?
	A [[tRNA]] binds to the A site of the [[ribosome]], then it adds its polypeptide to the chain (sort of diagonally), then it shoves the tRNA in the P site into the E site

## Termination
- How does elongation terminate?
	If a stop codon is detected, a release factor is input where the [[tRNA]] would have gone and water is introduced which hydrolyzes the translation unit
- What are post-translational modifications?
	They are the addition of other groups (sugars, lipids, phosphates) to the polypeptide to change its function as well as cutting out of certain [[amino acid]]s
# General
- What is a ribozyme?
	[[RNA]] molecules that can function as [[Enzymes]]
- What properties of [[RNA]] allow it to be useful as an [[Enzymes]]?
	1. It is single stranded so the [[Nucleotides]] can base pair with other things
	2. [[Nucleotides]] contain functional groups that can be used
	3. It can bind with other [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] molecules
		Such as in spliceosomes in [[RNA Splicing]]
- What is rRNA?
	It is a type of [[RNA]] found in [[ribosome]]s and it is the most abundant, it helps the structure of ribosomes
- What is wobble?
	It is the fact that the last part of the [[codons]] is flexible when it comes to pairing
- What effect does wobble have?
	It means that 20 types of [[tRNA]] can bind to the 61 possible [[codons]] of [[mRNA]]
