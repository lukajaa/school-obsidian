The number of elements in [[Set]] X is the cardinality of X (|X|)
- To see if two infinite sets have the same cardinality, we check if each item in one set can much two another item in the other
A function is one-to-one if one item from X matches onto one from Y, the function is **onto Y**
You can get the inverse function by mapping Y **onto X**
