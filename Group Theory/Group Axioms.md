A group of a set G, closed under [[Binary Operation]] \*, such that the 3 following axioms are satisfied:
1. The binary operation is associative. In other words, for x, y, z in G (x \* y) \*z = x \* (y \* z)
2. There is an element e in G, such that for all elements x in G, xe=ex=x ([[Identity Element]])
3. Each element x of G has an inverse $x^{-1}$ such that $x^{-1} * x = x * x^{-1} = e$
