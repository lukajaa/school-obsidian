- What is translation
	Translation is the process by which nucleotides in [[RNA]] are translated into amino acids in the form of proteins
- Where does translation occur?
	Ribosomes
-   How do the bases in RNA get translated into the amino acids in proteins?
    Triplets of bases (codons) in RNA (eg. ACT) turn into an amino acid. Additionally certain triplets represent the start (ATG) and end (TAA, TAG, TGA)
-   Why triplets of RNA bases?
    Because it was the minimum amount of letters that could have enough possible combinations.
- In which direction are mRNA strands transcribed?
	5' --> 3'
- What is the reading frame?
	Reading frame is how nucleotide "words" are read. You have to start in the right place and not overlap for it to work correctly.
