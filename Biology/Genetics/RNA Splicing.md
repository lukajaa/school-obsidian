- What is RNA splicing?
	[[RNA]] splicing is the process of cutting out the [[Introns]] from the pre-mRNA and binding together the [[Exons]] to create a continuous code
- How does RNA splicing work?
	snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) recognize [[nucleotides]] sequences at the ends of [[introns]]. They combine with each other and other [[protein]]s to create a **spliceosome** which removes and degreades the [[introns]] and binds together the [[exons]].

## Alternative RNA splicing
- What is alternative RNA splicing?
	Different segments of the pre mRNA can be treated as [[Exons]] meaning that multiple types of [[Protein]]s can be made from the same gene
- What are some effects of alternative RNA splicing?
	It can help create genetic diversity because it increases the chance of genetic mixing with more [[nucleotides]] to change.
