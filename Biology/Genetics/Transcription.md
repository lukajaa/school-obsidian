## Overview
- How does transcription work?
	[[DNA]] double helix is split by [[RNA Polymerase]] and corresponding nucleotides are created in a [[RNA]] strand. This is known as mRNA.
- Where does transcription take place?
	In the [[Nucleus]]
- What is a primary transcript?
	A primary transcript is the initial RNA transcript from a gene including parts of RNA that will not be translated.
- What is the template strand?
	The template strand is the half of the DNA that is transcribed to RNA
- What process follows transcription?
	[[RNA Processing]]

## Steps
- What is the first step of transcription?
	Initiation where [[RNA Polymerase]] attaches to the [[DNA]] and begins to split it
- What is the second step of transcription?
	Elongation where the [[RNA]] strand is elongated
- What is the third step of transcription?
	Termination when the [[terminator]] is reached and the [[RNA Polymerase]] breaks off

- What is one way transcription varies between pro and [[Eukaryotes]]?
	In [[prokaryotes]] the [[RNA Polymerase]] binds directly to the DNA, while in eukaryotes enzymes called [[Transcription Factor]]s are needed for the [[RNA Polymerase]] to bind.
