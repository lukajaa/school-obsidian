- What is RNA processing (broadly)?
	[[RNA]] processing is where the ends and sometimes the middle of the primary transcript of pre mRNA are altered to yield a final RNA molecule.
- Where does RNA Processing occur?
	RNA processing occurs in the [[Nucleus]]
- What is the polyandenylation signal?
	It is a series of AAUAAA [[Nucleotides]] that is appended to the pre mRNA after the stop codon.

- What is the 5' cap?
	The 5' cap is a modified form of the guanine [[Nucleotides]] added to the 5' side of the RNA
- What is the poly-A tail?
	The poly- A tail is a long strand of 5-250 adenine [[Nucleotides]] added to the 3' side of the per mRNA after the polyandenylation signal is detected
- What do the 5' cap and poly-A tail do?
	1. They help export completed mRNA out of the [[Nucleus]]
	2. They help the mRNA from being degraded
	3. They help bind to [[Ribosome]]s append to the 5' side of the RNA
