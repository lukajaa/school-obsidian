- What is tRNA?
	tRNA is a type of [[RNA]] folded in on itself with an anticodon that detects for a certain [[Codons]] to add to a polypeptide [[Protein]] chain. They each hold one [[Amino Acid]]
- How is an anticodon coded?
	It is coded as the opposite of the [[mRNA]] codon it is matching to
- How is tRNA made?
	It comes from [[DNA]] just like [[mRNA]], but it serves a different purpose
- How does the [[amino acid]] join with the tRNA?
	[[Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase]]
- How do they work in [[Translation]]?
	They cycle through the [[Ribosome]]s bringing in an [[Amino Acid]] and matching it to the next [[Codons]] in the mRNA
