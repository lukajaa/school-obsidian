- What is the promoter?
	The promoter is the part of the DNA before the [[Transcription Unit]] that [[RNA Polymerase]] latches onto to start [[Transcription]]
- What is the start point?
	The start point is the exact [[Nucleotides]] within the promoter where [[RNA]] synthesis actually begins
- What is a TATA box?
	It is a series of [[Nucleotides]] that contain TATA and they are a crucial promoter that brings in the [[transcription factor]]
