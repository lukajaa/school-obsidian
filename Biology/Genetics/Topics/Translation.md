- What is translation
	Translation is the process by which nucleotides in [[RNA]] are translated into amino acids in the form of [[Protein]]s
- Where does translation occur?
	[[Ribosome]]s (In the [[Cytoplasm]])
-   How do the bases in RNA get translated into the amino acids in proteins?
    Triplets of bases ([[Codons]]) in RNA (eg. ACT) turn into an amino acid. Additionally certain triplets represent the start (ATG) and end (TAA, TAG, TGA)
- What is the reading frame?
	Reading frame is how nucleotide "words" are read. You have to start in the right place and not overlap for it to work correctly.
- What happens after translation?
	It gets packaged, folded, and then occasionally shipped to other parts of the cell
- How can the process of translation be sped up using the same [[mRNA]] strand?
	[[Polyribosome]]s


## Initionation:
- What is initiation?
	[[mRNA]] binds to the smaller unit of the [[ribosome]], then [[tRNA]](always the MET [[amino acid]]) binds and then the large unit  of the [[ribosome]] comes down onto it. 
- What resources does initiation require?
	[[GTP]] and initiation factors

## Elongation
- What is the cycle of translation?
	A [[tRNA]] binds to the A site of the [[ribosome]], then it adds its polypeptide to the chain (sort of diagonally), then it shoves the tRNA in the P site into the E site

## Termination
- How does elongation terminate?
	If a stop codon is detected, a release factor is input where the [[tRNA]] would have gone and water is introduced which hydrolyzes the translation unit
- What happens to the polypeptide chain after it is released?
	It folds onto itself due to its [[amino acid]] formation
- What are post-translational modifications?
	They are the addition of other groups (sugars, lipids, phosphates) to the polypeptide to change its function as well as cutting out of certain [[amino acid]]s
