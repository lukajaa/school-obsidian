- What is translation
	Translation is the process by which nucleotides in [[RNA]] are translated into amino acids in the form of [[Protein]]s
- Where does translation occur?
	[[Ribosome]]s (In the [[Cytoplasm]])
-   How do the bases in RNA get translated into the amino acids in proteins?
    Triplets of bases ([[Codons]]) in RNA (eg. ACT) turn into an amino acid. Additionally certain triplets represent the start (ATG) and end (TAA, TAG, TGA)
- What is the reading frame?
	Reading frame is how nucleotide "words" are read. You have to start in the right place and not overlap for it to work correctly.
