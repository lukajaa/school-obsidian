- What is translation
	Translation is the process by which nucleotides in [[RNA]] are translated into amino acids in the form of [[Protein]]s
- Where does translation occur?
	[[Ribosome]]s (In the [[Cytoplasm]])
-   How do the bases in RNA get translated into the amino acids in proteins?
    Triplets of bases ([[Codons]]) in RNA (eg. ACT) turn into an amino acid. Additionally certain triplets represent the start (ATG) and end (TAA, TAG, TGA)
- What is the reading frame?
	Reading frame is how nucleotide "words" are read. You have to start in the right place and not overlap for it to work correctly.
- What happens after translation?
	It gets packaged, folded, and then occasionally shipped to other parts of the cell

## Initionation:
- What is initiation?
	[[tRNA]] binds and then the large unit  of the [[ribosome]] comes down onto it

## Elongation
- What is the cycle of translation?
	A [[tRNA]] binds to the A site of the [[ribosome]] where it adds its polypeptide to the chain (sort of diagonally), the A site tRNA moves to the P site, and then the tRNA in the P site moves to the E site

## Termination
- How does elongation terminate?
	If a stop codon is detected, a stop factor is input where the [[tRNA]] would have gone
