- What is a repressor?
	A repressor binds to the [[operator]] and prevents [[RNA Polymerase]] from attaching thereby preventing [[Transcription]] of that [[genes]]
- How do repressor function?
	A repressor for an enzyme that blocks creation of [[Enzymes]] that make [[amino acid]] "A" will need that amino acid to function. So, if that amino acid is hanging around it will bind to the repressor as a [[Corepressor]] and stop that enzyme from being made. It self regulates itself.
