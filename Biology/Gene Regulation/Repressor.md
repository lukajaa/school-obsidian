- What is a repressor?
	A repressor binds to the [[operator]] and prevents [[RNA Polymerase]] from attaching thereby preventing [[Transcription]] of that [[genes]]
- How does repressor function in [[Repressible Operon]]s?
	A repressor for an enzyme that blocks creation of [[Enzymes]] that make [[amino acid]] "A" will need that amino acid to function. So, if that amino acid is hanging around it will bind to the repressor as a [[Corepressor]] and stop that enzyme from being made. It self regulates itself.
- How does the repressor function in [[Inducible Operon]]s?
	By default, it will stop transcription, but when an [[Inducer]] like allolactose attaches to the repressor, the repressor becomes inactive and [[transcription]] can continue
