- What is a ribosome?
	It is a [[Organelle]] that translates [[mRNA]] to [[Protein]]s
- Where are the two places where ribosomes are found?
	In the [[Cytoplasm]] and embedded on other organelles like the [[Golgi Apparatus]], [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]], [[Nuclear Envelope]], [[Lysosome]]s, [[Vacuole]]s, and [[Plasma Membrane]]
==- How does a ribosome know where to go?==
	[[Translation]] of a polypeptide always starts in the [[Cytoplasm]], but if a signal peptide is detected by a signal-recognition particle (SRP) then the SRP brings it to where it needs to go. the signal peptide is later removed. Translation is only interuppted if it is moving the the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]
- What is the structure of a ribosome?
	It is a two unit organelle that has [[rRNA]]
- Where does the [[mRNA]] bind?
	In the smaller unit
- What is the A-site
	It is where the [[tRNA]] binds and where the the peptide carried by the tRNA first binds
- What is the P-site
	It is where the polypeptide comes out of and is where the tRNA goes
- What is the E-Site?
	It is where the [[tRNA]] exits

## Pro vs eukaryotes
- How do the differences of ribosomes in [[Prokaryotes]] and [[Eukaryotes]] change how medicine can work?
	The slight differences in [[rRNA]] means that drugs can target bacterial ribosomes with hurting eukaryotic ribosomes
