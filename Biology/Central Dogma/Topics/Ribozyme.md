- What is a ribozyme?
	[[RNA]] molecules that can function as [[Enzymes]]
- What properties of [[RNA]] allow it to be useful as an [[Enzymes]]?
	1. It is single stranded so the [[Nucleotides]] can base pair with other things
	2. [[Nucleotides]] contain functional groups that can be used
	3. It can bind with other [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] molecules
		Such as in spliceosomes in [[RNA Splicing]]
