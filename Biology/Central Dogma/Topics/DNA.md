- What is DNA?
	DNA carries the genetic information of the body
- What is the monomer of DNA?
	[[Nucleotides]]
- What is the central Dogma
	The central dogma is the idea that [[DNA]] --> [[RNA]] --> [[Protein]]
- How does the central Dogma differ in [[Prokaryotes]] and [[Eukaryotes]]?
	In eukaryotic cells transcription happens in the nucleus and then has to be shipped out, where as prokaryotic cells have no barrier and thus mRNA can be transcribed and translated at the same time.
## Packaging
- Around how long is all of the DNA in one cell?
	2 meters
- What are histones?
	Positively charged proteins that help to coil long strands of DNA
- What is the resulting DNA-protein complex called?
	Chromatin
- What is a nucleosome?
	A nucleosome is a group of eight histome proteins and around 146 DNA bases
- What are beads on a string?
	They are nucleosomes with linking DNA.
- How long is the string of nucleosomes?
	About one foot long, but still too large to fit into a nucleus
==- How does DNA coil and uncoil to be copied?==
	Histones can be modified by enzymes (acetyl, methyl, or phosphate) OR chromatin rendering complexes can remodel the DNA and expose sequences for polymerases to access. These are all reversible
- Why is DNA coiled the tightest in metaphase?
	Because it needs to be divided into its two daughter cells. Once it has been divided, it can uncoil again.
- What happens when a cell undergoes mitosis?
	The cell's chromatin packages tightly into chromosomes and then unpackages back into chromatin after it splits.
