# Part 1
- What happened in 2018 and what was the reaction of the scientific community?
	A Chinese scientist edited the genetic code of human embryos. The broader scientific community was outraged and disgusted by what he did.
- What gene disorder does Susannah Rosen have? What is the impact on her body/development?
	Motor skills and cognition problems that impacted her muscle control due to the KIF1A Gene. This impacted her ability to walk and may also affect her vision and lifespan
- What was the hypothesis of preformationism? 
	Each egg and sperm is a complete person that will grow up. Sort of like Russian dolls where a human contains a human that contains a human
- Summarize Mendel’s conclusion with his peas?
	He created the ideas of dominant and recessive traits. Recessive traits can be hidden, but are still there across generations
- What does Mukherjee mean when he says the word “gene” was born as an abstraction?
	People knew that genes held information that was passed through generatios, but they didn't know what it actually was in terms of molecular make up

# Part 2
1.  What did Thomas Hunt Morgan discover that went beyond Mendel’s findings?
	Genetically inherited traits are not unique/seperate from each other. Rather, they are strung together "like beads on a string". During exchange of genetic material, beads are sometimes swapped and close ones are swapped together.
2.  What came from the “greatest all nighter science has ever known”?
	d
3.  What tragedy motivates Dr. Chung’s work with children and families w/ rare diseases?
	Her second son died.
4.  In order to move forward in Kif1A research why did they need 100 patients and “a mouse”?
	So they can find other people with the same gene so they could find what was causing the mutation. Also they needed a mouse so they could test the experimental drugs.
