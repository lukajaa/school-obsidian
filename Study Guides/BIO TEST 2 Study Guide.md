# Overview
- What is gene regulation?
	Gene regulation is the turning off and on of certain [[Genes]] using [[Operon]]s
## Operon
- Where are operons found?
	Operons are found in [[Prokaryotes]] only
- What is an operon?
	It is the whole stretch of [[DNA]] composed of the [[Promoter]], [[Operator]], and multiple related [[Genes]]
- What are the two types of operons?
	[[Repressible Operon]] and [[Inducible Operon]]
## Operator
- What is an operator?
	An operator is the segment of [[DNA]] that controls the access of [[RNA Polymerase]] on the gene. It is the "on-off" switch in [[Gene Regulation]]
- Where is the operator located?
	The operator is usually located in the [[Promoter]] or between the promoter and the [[Genes]]
## Other
- What is a regulatory gene?
	A regulatory gene is a gene that is always expressed in small amounts that generates [[Repressor]]s or [[Inducer]]s

# Activator
- What is an activator?
	It is a type of [[protein]] that acts as a form of positive [[gene regulation]] by stimulating higher rates of [[transcription]] when it is attached to a gene
- How does an activator work?
	In E. Coli for example:
	When glucose levels are low, [[cAMP]] will accumulate and attach to [[CAP]] which in turn latches onto the [[Promoter]]'s [[CAP Site]] and increases [[transcription]]. This combined with the [[Inducible Operon]] from the increase in lactose being there makes it so that *lac* is only produced when glucose is low and lactose is high
## cAMP and CAP
- What is cAMP?
	It is a "hunger signal" that binds to [[CAP]] so that it can bind to the [[CAP Site]]
- What is CAP?
	It is a catabolite activator protein that binds to the [[CAP Site]] to encourage the [[RNA Polymerase]] to bind
- What is a CAP Site?
	A CAP site is where [[CAP]] binds once it has [[cAMP]] attached to it

# Repressible Operons
- What is a repressible operon?
	A repressible operon is usually on, but can be inhibited by a [[Repressor]] to be turned off. These create repressible [[Enzymes]]
- What type of metabolic processes do repressible operons work on?
	They usually work on anabolic processes. This is because once they have created the thing, that thing can act as a [[Corepressor]] to tell it to stop.
- What is a corepressor?
	A corepressor is a molecule that works with the [[Repressor]] to switch an [[Operon]] off
- What is a repressor?
	A repressor binds to the [[operator]] and prevents [[RNA Polymerase]] from attaching thereby preventing [[Transcription]] of that [[genes]]
- How does repressor function in [[Repressible Operon]]s?
	A repressor for an enzyme that blocks creation of [[Enzymes]] that make [[amino acid]] "A" will need that amino acid to function. So, if that amino acid is hanging around it will bind to the repressor as a [[Corepressor]] and stop that enzyme from being made. It self regulates itself.

# Inducible Operons
- What is a inducer?
	An inducer stops the [[Repressor]] from functioning on [[Inducible Operon]]s
- What is a inducible operon?
	A inducible operon is usually off, but can be turned on by deactivating the [[Repressor]] using a [[Inducer]]. These create inducible [[Enzymes]]
- What type of metabolic processes do inducible operons work on?
	Catabolic processes because you only need to make a [[protein]] to do something if the thing it is going to break down is there
- How does the repressor function in [[Inducible Operon]]s?
	By default, it will stop transcription, but when an [[Inducer]] like allolactose attaches to the repressor, the repressor becomes inactive and [[transcription]] can continue

# Transformation
- What is a plasmid?
	A plasmid is a small circular piece of [[DNA]] that can have a [[genes]] placed on it that is separate from the bacteriaâ€™s [[chromosomes]]
- What is transformation?
	Transformation is when a cell takes up a new gene and expresses it?
- How does it work in [[prokaryotes]] to make synthetic human products?
	Transformation is the process in which a [[DNA]] is placed onto a [[plasmid]] and is then placed into a bacteria in hopes that it will survive and reproduce with the new DNA.

# Eukaryotic Gene Regulation
- What is [[Methylation]]?
	Methylation can happen on either [[Chromatin]] or [[DNA]]. 
	1. When chromatin gets packed super tightly
	2. When it blocks the DNA
- What is Acetylation?
	It is the unpacking of [[Chromatin]] that allows for higher rates of transcription because more [[DNA]] is exposed
- What is a transcription factor?
	Transcription factors are a collection of proteins that mediate the binding of [[RNA Polymerase]] and the start of [[Transcription]]
- What is a transcription initiation complex?
	It is when all of the transcription factors have bound to the [[Promoter]] and then the [[RNA Polymerase]] can bind
- What is [[miRNA]] and [[SiRNA]]?
	[[RNA]]s that break apart [[mRNA]]
- What is [[Deadenylation]]
	Breaks apart the poly-a tail and 5' cap of the [[mRNA]] that are added during [[RNA Processing]]
- What is Protein Activation
	Phosphorylizing with [[ATP]] that can activate the proteins
- What is Ubiquization
	[[Ubiquitin]] is a protein marker that tells proteins to go the proteasome to get broken down
