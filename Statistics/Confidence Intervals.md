- What is a confidence interval?
	It is a range of values centered around the mean that gives likely numbers for the result
- What does a 95% confidence interval mean?
	It means that if we calculated a confidence interval for a 100 different samples, then 95 of them would contain the true mean
- Can you get a 100% confidence interval?
	No. If you do then the range would be -infinity to positive infinity
- How do you calculate a confidence interval?
	X +/- Z(s / sqrt(n))
	where
	X = mean
	Z = z score that you want
	s = standard deviation
	n = sample size
