Well defined collection of things {a, b, c}
Qualities:
1. As set is made of elements, and if element a is in the set then  $a\in S$ 
2. There is exactly one set with no elements ([[Empty Set]]) and is denoted by $\emptyset$
3. To define elements in set
	1. {a, b, c}
	2. "the set of all real numbers"
	3. All values of x for which P(x) is true
4. All sets are well defined  (a is in either in or not in a set)
- A set B is a **subset of set A** as denoted by B 
- A is the **improper subset** of A, all other subsets are **proper**
- A x B = {(a, b), | a $\in$ A and b $\in$ B }
$\mathbb{Z}$ = set of all integers
$\mathbb{Q}$ = set of all rational numbers
$\mathbb{R}$ = set of all real numbers
$\mathbb{C}$ = set of all complex numbers
$\mathbb{Z}^{*}$ = set of nonzero numbers in given sets 
$\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ = set of all positive numbers in given sets 

$a \mathrel{R} b$ if a (in set A) is related to b (in set B)
- $a \mathrel{R} b = (a,b)\in \mathrel{R}$
