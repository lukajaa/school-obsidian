- 3S Strategy
	Statistic, simulate, and strength of evidence. A way to disprove null hypothesis
- Alternative Hypothesis
	The not by chance / some outside force is affecting your experiment
- Bar graph
	A graphical display of a distribution of a categorial variable
- Binary variable
	Categorical variable with two outcomes
- Central Limit Theorem
	A mathematical prediction of behavior of the null distribution when certain validity conditions are met
- Chance Models
	A real / computerized process to generate data according to certain conditions
- Expected number of failures
	How many failures we expect from a given sample n(1 - pi)
- Expected number of successes
	How many successes we expect n * pi
- Model
	A mathematical / probabilistic conceptualization meant so simulate reality, but it makes assumptions that aren't neccesarily true in reality
- n
	Sample size
- Normally Distributed
	How the normal distribution bell curve is described
- Null distribution
	Distribution of simulated statistics that represent what would happen if null distribution was true
- Null Hypothesis
	By chance outcomes you would expect
==- One proportion z-test==
	The theory based approach for inference for a single proportion
- Parameter
	Long run numerical probability
- pi 
	parameter
- p - hat
	The observed statistic
- Plausible
	Reasonable / believable explanation for the data we observed
- p - value
	The probability of getting a statistic that is at least as extreme as the one we got when the null hypothesis was true
- Sample
	The set of observed values
- Sample Size
	The number of observational units
- Sampling distribution of a sample proportion
	With the same sample size n, the theoretical distribution given the probability parameter
- Significance Level
	The value used as a criteria for how small a p-value needs to be to reject the null hypothesis
- Standardize
	To standardize an observation compute the distance between mean and observation and divide by the standard deviation 
	(p hat - mean) / sd
- Statistic
	A number computed from the sample
- Statistically Significant
	Unlikely to occur randomly
- Strength
	How much evidence there is against the null hypothesis
- Subjects
	Study participants that are human
- Test of Significance
	A procedure for measuring strength of evidence against the null hypothesis
- Theory-based Approach
	Mathematical approach which predicts the shape, center and variability of the null distribution instead of simulation
- Two sided test
	Estimates p-value by looking at how extreme the statistic is on either side
- Validity conditions
	Conditions that rended the theory-based approach valid
- z - statistic
	p - hat - mean / sd
