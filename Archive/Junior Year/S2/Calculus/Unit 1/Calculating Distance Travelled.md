## For constants
d = v * t

## [[Integrals]]
The area under the curve of velocity is distance travelled. As you make the intervals between the points smaller, you become more accurate because the upper and lower bounds are becoming closer together.

- What is a left hand sum?
	You start the rectangle on the right side point. Underestimate for positive functions, overestimate for negatives functions

N = number of rectangles
t_n = x value at the n rectangle
f(t_n) = y value at the n rectangle
