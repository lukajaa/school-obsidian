- What is a mutation?
	Mutations are mistakes in a cell's [[DNA]] that leads to abnormal [[Amino Acid]]s being produced
- What is a point mutation?
	Point mutations are where one [[Nucleotides]] changes, resulting in one [[Amino Acid]] changing
- What is a frame-shift mutation?
	Frame shift mutations add/remove one nucleotide resulting in the reading frame of the [[DNA]]/[[RNA]] to be changed and this changes every [[Amino Acid]] that it would create.
- What is a silent mutation?
	Silent mutations are mutations that don't effect the [[Amino Acid]] output, usually due to [[Wobble]]
- What is a missense mutation?
	Missense mutations cause an [[Amino Acid]] to be turned into a different amino acid,
- What is a nonsense mutation?
	Non-sense mutations cause an [[Amino Acid]] to be turned into a stop [[Codons]]. 

- What is a conservative mutation?
	It is one where the amino acid changes into a similar [[Amino Acid]] with similar properties
- What is a non-conservative mutation?
	It is one where the amino acid changes into an [[Amino Acid]] with different properties
