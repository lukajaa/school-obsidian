- What is an activator?
	It is a type of [[Protein]] that acts as a form of positive [[Gene Regulation]] by stimulating higher rates of [[Transcription]] when it is attached to a gene
- How does an activator work?
	In E. Coli for example:
	When glucose levels are low, [[cAMP]] will accumulate and attach to [[CAP]] which in turn latches onto the [[Promoter]]'s [[CAP Site]] and increases [[Transcription]]. This combined with the [[Inducible Operon]] from the increase in lactose being there makes it so that *lac* is only produced when glucose is low and lactose is high
