# Interspecific Interactions
>Interspecific interactions can be grouped into three categories +/- (zero sum eg. predation), +/+ (symbiotic), and 0 (no effect)
## Competition (-/-)
Interspecific competition is competition over a certain resource (often food) such as grass or shared prey
### Competitive Exclusion
When two organisms fight for the same limited food source, if one has even a slight reproductive edge, it will kill out the other species.
### Ecological Niche
An ecological niche is the sum of a species' resource usage defined by **resource partitioning**. Two species cannot occupy the same ecological niche, otherwise competitive exclusion would occur
Possible Niches Include
- Time (nocturnal / diurnal)
- Place (higher up / lower down)
#### Fundamental Niche
Fundamental niche is the niche is the niche that an animal would occupy without any competition (what it is made to do)
#### Realized Niche
Realized niche is the niche that the organism actually occupies due to competition or other factors
### Character Displacement
Character displacement is the phenomenon that species separated can be mores similar than overlapping species

## Predation (+/-)
### Predators
Predators often have adaptations like fangs, claws, etc to attack their prey. 
### Prey
#### Coloration
Camouflage (cryptic coloration) and bright warning colors (aposematic coloration) are used by prey to avoid predators
#### Mimicry
Prey can also mimic dangerous species (Batesian Mimicry)

## Symbiosis
Symbiosis is when two organisms live in close and intimate contact with each other
### Parasitism (+/-)
Parasitism is when a parasite organism feeds on a host organism and takes its nutrients, oftentimes damaging the reproductive and survival ability of the host organism
#### Endoparasite
Endoparasites attach to the inside of the host (eg. tapeworms)
#### Exoparasite
Exoparasites attach to the outside of the host (eg. ticks)

### Mutualism (+/+)
Mutualism is a mutually beneficial form of symbiosis in which two organisms help each other
#### Obligate Mutualism
One organism has the lost the ability to survive without the other
#### Facilitative Mutualism
Both organisms can survive independently
#### Coevolution
Mutualistic organisms sometimes coevolve in tandem with each other such as flowering plants and bees
### Commensalism (+/0)
Commensalistic relationships are relationships where one species benefits without affecting the other in either way
Commensalistic relationships are hard (and prove to be truly commensalistic) to find but a few examples include:
- Algae growing on turtles
- Bird that find food in the grass after it being exposed by cattle


## Facilitation (+/+) or (+/0)
Facilitation is where one species has an effect on another species without being in direct, intimate contact with them
An example is Juncus gerardi which helps plants grown in soil by preventing salt buildup.

# Diversity and trophic structure
>Diversity and trophic structure are attributes of an ecosystem that play a role in how they act
## Species Diversity
Species diversity is the variety of different organisms in an ecosystem; it can be hard to measure due to very rare organisms and microorganisms
### Species Richness
Species richness is the number of species there are
### Relative Abundance
Relative abundance is the percentage that each species takes up
> Useful because species richness doesn't always show diversity because 99% of trees could be one species
### Shannon Diversity Index
H = - (Pa In Pa + Pb In Pb + Pc In Pc + ...)
Where a, b, c are different species and Pa, Pb, Pc are the percentage of those species

## Diversity and Community Stability
The more diverse an ecosystem is, the more stable it is and more resistant it is to **invasive predators**

## Trophic Structure
Trophic structure examines how energy moves from primary producers (plants) to primary consumers (herbivores) to secondary/tertiary/quaternary consumers (carnivores)
### Food Webs
You can organize trophic structure into a food web to examine who eats who
You can simplify food webs by grouping similar species and isolating species that don't interact very much
### Limits on Food Chain Length
Food chains are normally less than 5 species in length, with the longest not be much longer than 7
#### Energetic Hypothesis
The **Energetic Hypothesis** suggests that only 10% of energy can be moved between each trophic level (100kg of plant matter can only sustain 10kg of herbivore biomass), limiting the length of food chains
#### Dynamic Stability Hypothesis
The **Dynamic Stability Hypothesis** suggests that smaller chains are more stable because population loss is magnified by each link in the food chain


## Species with a Large Impact
### Dominant Species
Dominant species are the species that are either the most abundant or have the highest biomass. Hypothesis suggest that they have a competitive edge in resource usage compared to other species. The death of a dominant species can drastically effect the whole ecosystem
### Keystone Species
Keystone species are not dominant, but they usually occupy a specific niche that makes them important
#### Trophic Interactions
Sea otters eat sea urchins which eat kelp. When sea otters are present, kelp forests are healthy, but when they are absent or get eaten, then kelp forests collapse
#### Ecosystem Engineers
Beavers are ecosystem engineers who engineer the environment and thereby have a large impact on the ecosystem

## Bottom-Up and Top-down Controls
Arrows indicate that a change in biomass affects another trophic level. There are three general levels: v -> h (increase in vegetation increases herbivore biomass), h -> v (increase in herbivore biomass will decrease the abundance of vegetation), h <-> v (both of the species affect each other)
### Bottom-Up Model (v->h)
The simple form is n -> v -> h -> p
Where n is nutrients, v is vegetation, h is herbivores, and p is predators. Thus, to change the make up of this ecosystem you have to add more nutrients to the soil which increases the number of all above tiers.
### Top-Down Model (v<-h)
The simple form is n <- v <- h <- p
If p is reduce, h is increased which reduces v, which increases n. This creates an alternating effect of increase and decreases.

# Disturbance
>A disturbance is an event that changes the organism makeup of an ecosystem, supporting the **non equilibrium model** because disturbances are constantly changing communities.
## Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis
Moderate levels of disturbance create more diversity than either small or high levels. This is because high levels of disturbance totally shatter ecosystems and small levels of disturbance often only harm certain groups, allowing other existing groups to take over, thereby reducing diversity.
### High levels of disturbance
High levels of disturbance, such as natural forest fires, can also be beneficial in healing an environment

## Ecological Succession
Ecological succession is when a disturbed area's existing community is replaced by a set of new species, and then another, and then another.
### Types
**Primary Succession** occurs when species start to replace an area that was left totally bare
**Secondary Succession** occurs when an existing community is cleared by something that leaves the soil intact

## Human Disturbance
Human activities such as trawling, deforestation, agriculture, and industry are the main drivers of ecosystem disturbance nowadays

# Biogeographic Factors
>The area and latitude of communities are two other factors that influence an ecosystem
## Latitudinal Gradients
There are multiple reasons why the tropics have more diversity:
1. The tropics have had to "start over" less due to them being less impacted by ice ages and warming
2. The tropics have a longer growing season
3. Evapotranspiration
### Evapotranspiration
Evapotranspiration is a metric of solar radiation, temperature and water availability.

## Area Effects
### Species-Area Curve
All other factors being equal, the larger and area is the more species it will have, likely due to a higher number of microclimates

## Island Equilibrium Model
The number of species immigrating and emigrating from an island will eventually reach an equilibrium, decided by the size of the island and its distance from the mainland
### Factors
- Large Islands will have higher rates of immigration because they have a bigger area
- Small Islands will have higher rates of extinction because they have less resources
- The more species on an island, the higher the extinction rate because of competition
- Islands closer to the mainland will have higher rates of immigration
