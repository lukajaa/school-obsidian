# Interspecific Interactions
>Interspecific interactions can be grouped into three categories +/- (zero sum eg. predation), +/+ (symbiotic), and 0 (no effect)
## Competition (-/-)
Interspecific competition is competition over a certain resource (often food) such as grass or shared prey
### Competitive Exclusion
When two organisms fight for the same limited food source, if one has even a slight reproductive edge, it will kill out the other species.
### Ecological Niche
An ecological niche is the sum of a species' resource usage defined by **resource partitioning**. Two species cannot occupy the same ecological niche, otherwise competitive exclusion would occur
Possible Niches Include
- Time (nocturnal / diurnal)
- Place (higher up / lower down)
#### Fundamental Niche
Fundamental niche is the niche is the niche that an animal would occupy without any competition (what it is made to do)
#### Realized Niche
Realized niche is the niche that the organism actually occupies due to competition or other factors
### Character Displacement
Character displacement is the phenomenon that species separated can be mores similar than overlapping species

## Predation (+/-)
### Predators
Predators often have adaptations like fangs, claws, etc to attack their prey. 
### Prey
#### Coloration
Camouflage (cryptic coloration) and bright warning colors (aposematic coloration) are used by prey to avoid predators
#### Mimicry
Prey can also mimic dangerous species (Batesian Mimicry)

## Symbiosis
Symbiosis is when two organisms live in close and intimate contact with each other
### Parasitism (+/-)
Parasitism is when a parasite organism feeds on a host organism and takes its nutrients, oftentimes damaging the reproductive and survival ability of the host organism
#### Endoparasite
Endoparasites attach to the inside of the host (eg. tapeworms)
#### Exoparasite
Exoparasites attach to the outside of the host (eg. ticks)

### Mutualism (+/+)
Mutualism is a mutually beneficial form of symbiosis in which two organisms help each other
#### Obligate Mutualism
One organism has the lost the ability to survive without the other
#### Facilitative Mutualism
Both organisms can survive independently
#### Coevolution
Mutualistic organisms sometimes coevolve in tandem with each other such as flowering plants and bees
### Commensalism (+/0)
Commensalistic relationships are relationships where one species benefits without affecting the other in either way
Commensalistic relationships are hard (and prove to be truly commensalistic) to find but a few examples include:
- Algae growing on turtles
- Bird that find food in the grass after it being exposed by cattle


## Facilitation (+/+) or (+/0)
Facilitation is where one species has an effect on another species without being in direct, intimate contact with them
An example is Juncus gerardi which helps plants grown in soil by preventing salt buildup.
