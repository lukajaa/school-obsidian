# Interspecific Interactions
>Interspecific interactions can be grouped into three categories +/- (zero sum eg. predation), +/+ (symbiotic), and 0 (no effect)

## Competition (-/-)
Interspecific competition is competition over a certain resource (often food) such as grass or shared prey
### Competitive Exclusion
When two organisms fight for the same limited food source, if one has even a slight reproductive edge, it will kill out the other species.
### Ecological Niche
An ecological niche is the sum of a species' resource usage defined by **resource partitioning**. Two species cannot occupy the same ecological niche, otherwise competitive exclusion would occur
Possible Niches Include
- Time (nocturnal / diurnal)
- Place (higher up / lower down)
#### Fundamental Niche
Fundamental niche is the niche is the niche that an animal would occupy without any competition (what it is made to do)
#### Realized Niche
Realized niche is the niche that the organism actually occupies due to competition or other factors
### Character Displacement
Character displacement is the phenomenon that species separated can be mores similar than overlapping species

## Predation (+/-)
### Predators
Predators often have adaptations like fangs, claws, etc to attack their prey
### Prey
#### Coloration
Camouflage (cryptic coloration) and bright warning colors (aposematic coloration) are used by prey to avoid predators
#### Mimicry
Prey can also mimic dangerous species (Batesian Mimicry)
## Herbivore
Animals that prey on

## Herbivory

## Symbiosis
